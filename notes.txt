Issues needed to resolve:
    when running tsc I received "The term 'tsc' is not recognized as the name of a cmdlet, function, script file, or operable program. Check the spelling of the name, or if a path was included, verify that the path is correct and try again"
        This gave me an answer (install typescript globally worked)
